### Hi there! 👋 About me...

I'm passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems. Currently working as an IT Assistant at MTP Brasil, and pursuing a degree in Systems Analysis and Development at Cruzeiro do Sul University. I am also proud to hold an [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner](https://www.credly.com/badges/517fd129-d1e7-4851-a9f7-09a2abadbf01/linked_in?t=s0xbxa).<br>
