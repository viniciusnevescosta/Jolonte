### Hi there! 👋 About me...

I'm passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems. Currently working as an IT Assistant at MTP Brasil, I hold a Technical Degree in Systems Analysis and Development from ETEC. I am also proud to be an [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner](https://www.credly.com/badges/517fd129-d1e7-4851-a9f7-09a2abadbf01/linked_in?t=s0xbxa).
